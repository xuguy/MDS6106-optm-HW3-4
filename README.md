# MDS 6106 Optimization HW3+4

This repo contains all necessary files (code/dataset/pictures/tex) for homework 3 and 4. Run codes sequentially, do not alter path.

## File descritpions

- Qestions sheets are named `sheet_03_optm_24.pdf` and `sheet_04_optm_24.pdf`
- For HW 3, only question Q3.1 requires coding for experiments of 2 different line search methods, and the line search methods are packed in `optHW3A3.1.ipynb`, the remaining questions for HW3 are maths induction, check `MDS6106_hw3_Guyuanxu_224040074.pdf` and the corresponding `.tex` file with same name
- For HW 4, both questions needs coding for experiments, all codes for experiments are packed in `OptHW4_A4.1_experiments.py`, run all codes sequentially, do not alter path, check comments inside `.py` file if you are confused.
